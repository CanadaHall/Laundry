- **Real-Time Updates:** The website provides real-time information on machine availability, helping residents plan their laundry schedule effectively.
- **Cycle Completion Notifications:** Residents receive timely notifications when their laundry cycle is complete, allowing them to collect their items promptly and free up the machine for others.

### Features

### How It Works
