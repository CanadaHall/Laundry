## Overview

The Laundry Management System is an innovative solution designed to enhance convenience for residents. This system simplifies the process of managing shared laundry machines by:

-   **QR Code Integration:** Each machine is equipped with a unique QR code. Residents can scan the code to mark the machine as "in use" on the system's website.
-   **Real-Time Updates:** The website provides real-time information on machine availability, helping residents plan their laundry schedule effectively.
-   **Cycle Completion Notifications:** Residents receive timely notifications when their laundry cycle is complete, allowing them to collect their items promptly and free up the machine for others.

### Features

-   Streamlined laundry management with QR codes.
-   Transparent machine usage tracking.

### How It Works

1. Scan the QR code on the laundry machine using your smartphone.
2. The machine status is instantly updated on the Laundry Management System website.
